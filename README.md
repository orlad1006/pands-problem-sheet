## Week 1:  

Title: helloworld.py  

Task: Print "Hello World"  

## Week 2:  

Title: bank.py  

Task: Create a program that inputs two values in cents and then adds the two amounts and outputs the total in euro and cents  

## Week 3:
Title: accounts.py  

Task: Create a program that inputs a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only last 4 digits displaying.  

Replace the first 6 digits with X

I did this by creating a variable that asked the user to input and account number.  
I then outputed the last 4 digits by using [0:-4] and prefixing with 6 'X'
